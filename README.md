# license plate OCR system that works even on very blurry images

Unlike most systems that perform OCR directly on images,
My system first enhances the image quality and then performs OCR with a very powerful AI model with over 95% accuracy.
This allows it to OCR blurry, dim, and angled license plate images with very high accuracy.

Below are some examples where police OCR software failed to recognize license plates, but my system....

This system, with 4 Al models together, offers much better performance than previous license plate reader systems. Because it first de-blurs the license plate and then performs OCR on it.
This system is currently capable of being deployed in CCTV cameras across the country as the main license plate reader software.
This system is fully usable in organizations that improve the quality of license plate images.

I completed the entire process of this project, from training the models to its implementation, in about 4 months:
. Creating a roadmap and choosing the right technology for this task
. Collecting datasets and training the yolo and restormer models
. Creating a gui
. Final implementation

The pipeline follows a multi-stage architecture:

1. **YOLOv11** for license plate detection and segmentation  
2. A robust module for precise cropping and automatic perspective correction  
3. **Restormer** for enhancing plate image quality (deblurring, denoising, low-light correction)  
4. Custom OCR module for accurate character recognition under real-world conditions
